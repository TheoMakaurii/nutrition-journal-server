# Node Boilerplate!

basic boilerplate for any express programming I might do

## Some tips and tricks!

Look over and complete the following steps to start a new project (call it whatever you like!):

1. Clone this repository to your local machine `git clone https://github.com/TheoMakaurii/node-boilerplate.git YOUR-NEW-PROJECT-NAME`
2. `cd` into the cloned repository
3. Make a fresh start of the git history for this project with --> `rm -rf .git && git init`
4. You will need to install the node dependencies --> `npm install`
5. Move the example Environment file to `.env` that will be ignored by git and read by the express server `mv example.env .env`
6. Edit the contents of the `package.json` to use NEW-PROJECT-NAME instead of `"name": "express-boilerplate",`

## Scripts

Start the application --> `npm start`

Start nodemon for the application --> `npm run dev`

Run the tests --> `npm test`

Happy Hacking!!
